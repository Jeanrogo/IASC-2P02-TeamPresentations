Prism is a web tool designed with the purpose of crowdsourcing interpretation. It aims to find the general opinion in a paricular written 
work by asking users to highlight sections of the work according to different categories called "facets"

For many written works the intention of the writer and the take away value of the audience can be drastically different. Prism seeks to
narrow this gap using crowdsourcing and "facets" to highlight what percentage of a writing aligns with the writers views and what are 
irrelevant

the platform is catered for both academic and non-academic purpose 

Main features:
  Create: You can add your own or other written works to prism to get a general subjective interpretation of your work.
          For this you need the text, upto three "facets", title of the text, author of the text publication date, and the language of 
          the text. You may also add a brief description of the text. Prism offers an unlisted option while adding the work. This removes
          your work from searches limiting the number of people having access to your prism. Prism also needs you to specify the license 
          of the work your turning into a "Prism" 
  Play: In the play section you can browse the various prisms added to the platform. To contribute select a Prism of your liking and begin
